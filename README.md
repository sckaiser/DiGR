# DiGR
Directional Graphs for R functions
Plots the relationship between functions as a directional graph.

## Motivation and Description
I often find it useful to visualize how a set of functions which are typically called together (possibly from some master function) relate to each other.

## Methodology
to be added...

## Getting Started
Run the script DiGR.R; at the end, it will produce a directional graph of how the different functions in DiGR call each other.
[A real-world example.](https://github.com/sckaiser/BlindDate/blob/master/Digraph_functions.png) is provided to help visualize the code; I update it on an ad hoc basis.

## Dependencies
